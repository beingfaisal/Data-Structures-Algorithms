# Data-Structures-Algorithms
Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms Data Structure is a way of collecting and organising data in such a way that we can
perform operations on these data in an effective way. Data Structures is about rendering data elements in terms of some relationship, 
for better organization and storage. For example, we have some data which has, player's name "Virat" and age 26. Here "Virat" is of String data type
and 26 is of integer data type.
We can organize this data as a record like Player record, which will have both player's name and age in it. Now we can collect and store
player's records in a file or database as a data structure. For example: "Dhoni" 30, "Gambhir" 31, "Sehwag" 33
If you are aware of Object Oriented programming concepts, then a class also does the same thing, it collects different type of data under
one single entity. The only difference being, data structures provides for techniques to access and manipulate data efficiently.
In simple language, Data Structures are structures programmed to store ordered data, so that various operations can be performed on
it easily. It represents the knowledge of data to be organized in memory. It should be designed and implemented in such a way that it
reduces the complexity and increases the efficiency.
Basic types of Data Structures As we have discussed above, anything that can store data can be called as a data structure, hence Integer,
Float, Boolean, Char etc, all are data structures. They are known as Primitive Data Structures.
Then we also have some complex Data Structures, which are used to store large and connected data. Some example of Abstract Data Structure 
are :
Linked List Tree Graph Stack, Queue etc. All these data structures allow us to perform different operations on data. 
We select these data structures based on which type of operation is required. We will look into these data structures in more 
details in our later lessons.
Introduction to Data Structures
The data structures can also be classified on the basis of the following characteristics:
Characterstic Description Linear In Linear data structures,the data items are arranged in a linear sequence. 
Example: Array Non-Linear In Non-Linear data structures,the data items are not in sequence. Example: Tree, Graph Homogeneous 
In homogeneous data structures,all the elements are of same type. Example: Array Non-Homogeneous In Non-Homogeneous data structure, 
the elements may or may not be of the same type. Example: Structures Static Static data structures are those whose sizes and 
structures associated memory locations are fixed, at compile time. Example: Array Dynamic Dynamic structures are those which expands or 
shrinks depending upon the program need and its execution. Also, their associated memory locations changes. Example: Linked List.
